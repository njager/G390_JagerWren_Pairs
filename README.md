# G390_JagerWren_Pairs
About
    For this prototype Steven and I wanted to focus on design, as we're both programmers we figured it owuld be good to step out of our comfort zones a little. This is why we chose a puzzle game that required very little programming to implement.
    The theme inspired this game because the player controls two separate characters that move in unison - a pair. The two sides of the level are different, and players can not desync in the Z because they are bound by a string of fate (the red line). The game has three levels, from easy to hard. The aesthetics are minimalist.
Controls
    WASD to move.
    R to reset.
Assets
    All assets are primitives made in Unity, except for the Third Person Controller module.
    The sound effect is a cheer found on freesound.org.
